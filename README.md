# Messages-From-The-Grave
Messages from the Grave is a desktop app that sends messages to loved ones in the event of the death of the email account holder to commemorate important milestones such as graduation, the birth of a child as well as a wedding. It uses the Nylas API as well as ChatGPT and is programmed in Java, using the Swing framework for its Graphical User Interface (GUI). It can be used on a Windows, Linux as well as macOS operating system. For the purposes of this repository, Apache Netbeans 12.3 is used for demonstrative purposes but there is no reason why another Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that can compile, build and run a Java program cannot be used.
